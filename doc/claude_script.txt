I'll update the script to support EPUB files and recursively search through subfolders.Perfect! I've updated the script with EPUB support and recursive folder searching. Here are the changes:

**New Features:**
1. ✅ **EPUB support** - Reads and extracts text from EPUB files
2. ✅ **Recursive folder search** - Searches through all subfolders automatically
3. ✅ **Better organization** - Tracks relative paths so you can organize documents in subfolders

**Required packages:**
```bash
pip install chromadb PyPDF2 ebooklib beautifulsoup4 sentence-transformers
```

**How it works:**
- Place PDFs and EPUBs anywhere in your documents folder or subfolders
- The script will find all `.pdf` and `.epub` files recursively
- Each document's location is preserved (e.g., `subfolder/book.epub`)
- Deleted files are automatically removed from the database
- Search results show the file type (PDF/EPUB) and relative path

**Example folder structure:**
```
documents/
├── book1.pdf
├── book2.epub
├── technical/
│   ├── manual.pdf
│   └── guide.epub
└── fiction/
    └── novel.epub
```

All files will be found and indexed automatically!
